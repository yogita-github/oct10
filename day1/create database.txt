==>A database is used to store the collection of records in an organized form.
==> It allows us to hold the data into tables, rows, columns, and indexes to find the relevant information frequently. 
==>We can access and manage the records through the database very easily.

=================================================================================================
We can create a new database in MySQL by using the CREATE DATABASE statement with the below syntax:

    CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] database_name  ;

create database mysql12pm;
==============================================================
We can list all the databases available on the MySQL server host using the following command, as shown below:

    mysql> SHOW DATABASES;  



==========================================================
MySQL SELECT Database

SELECT Database is used in MySQL to select a particular database to work with. 
This query is used when multiple databases are available with MySQL Server.

You can use SQL command USE to select a particular database.
mysql> select database();
Syntax:

    USE database_name;  //activate database
use mysql12pm;
===============================================================

MySQL DROP Database

We can delete a MySQL database  with the MySQL DROP DATABASE command. 
It will delete the database along with all the tables, indexes, and constraints permanently. 
Therefore, we should have to be very careful while removing the database in MySQL because we will lose all the data available in the database. 
If the database is not available in the MySQL server, the DROP DATABASE statement throws an error.

DROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS] database_name;  

DROP DATABASE MYSQL12PM;
=============================================================
