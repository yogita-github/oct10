The MySQL DELETE Statement
==>The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
==>The DELETE statement allows you to delete rows from a table and returns the number of deleted rows.
==>It is a Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement.
==>we can either delete the entire data in a table using DELETE or else we can also delete only some specific rows from the table.
==>using delete command ,It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact.
==>Once we delete the records using this query, we cannot recover it. Therefore before deleting any records from the table, it is recommended to create a backup of your database. 
==>If we want to delete all records from a table without knowing the count of deleted rows, we must use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement that gives better performance.

syntax:
------

delete from <tblName>;

delete from <tblName> where <condition>;
The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!


ex 1:delete from student where percentage<=50.0;

ex 2:delete from student
The following SQL statement deletes all rows in the "student" table, without deleting the table:

MYSQL TUTORIAL
ASSIGNMENTS

CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id INT ,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100) ,
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);

1)  delete a single row from the contacts table:

DELETE FROM contacts
WHERE id = 1;

In this example, the DELETE statement deletes the row with id 1. Since the condition returns only one row, the DELETE statement deleted a single row.The output indicates that one row was deleted.
===============================================
2) Delete multiple rows example

DELETE FROM contacts
WHERE last_name = 'Smith';

Output:

Query OK, 6 rows affected (0.01 sec)
The output indicates that 6 rows were deleted.
